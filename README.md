## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json

{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "recEVXrilPmCrYKDC",
            "fields": {
                "country": "united states",
                "state": "california",
                "city": "san diego",
                "location": "balboa park",
                "image": "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTzbeq247_lSXhrjxJDwJfnw2qmGn-BMwEMaw&usqp=CAU",
                "fee": "No"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-07-13T15:00:34.000Z"
        }
    ],
    "offset": "recEVXrilPmCrYKDC"
}
```

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I am sure I can achieve my MVP and get the App working using knowledge I gained from React lectures.

### Opportunities:
Great opportunity to get more comfortable with React's functional method and create a user fiendly website where users can share their travelling experinces and explore others experiences.

### Threats:
 Try my best to be able to debug the errors in my code and overcome issues I am going to face during this project. I would also try to reach out for help frequently instead of wasting my time and energy on something that I know I can get help to solve easier and faster.
